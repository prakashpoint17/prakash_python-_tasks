# Day 2 – Python Basics & Git Workflow 🚀

## 📘 Learning Topics Covered

### Python Basics Recap
- Variables
- Data Types (int, float, string, boolean)
- Operators

### Core Concepts
- Input / Output
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions
- Modules
- Virtual Environment usage

---

## 🧪 Practical Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ Virtual Environment Setup
- Created project folder `day2_python`
- Created and activated virtual environment using `venv`
- Successfully ran Python programs inside the virtual environment

## 🧩 Python Programs Implemented

### Task List

| Task No | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [Accept user name and greet](task1_greet.py) |
| 2 | [Basic calculator using input](task2_calculator.py) |
| 3 | [Check even or odd number](task3_evenvsodd.py) |
| 4 | [Find largest of three numbers](task4_largestnum.py) |
| 5 | [Print multiplication table](task5_multable.py) |
| 6 | [Reverse a string (without built-in functions)](task6_revstr.py) |
| 7 | [Check if a number is prime](task7_prime.py) |
| 8 | [Generate Fibonacci series](task8_fibonacci.py) |

---

## 🛠 Utility Module (`utils.py`)
[`utils.py`](utils.py)
The following reusable utility functions were implemented:

- `is_prime(n)` – checks whether a number is prime
- `reverse_string(s)` – reverses a string manually
- `fibonacci(n)` – returns Fibonacci series up to `n` terms

These functions are imported and used in the respective task files.
